# DSC Project Books Redistribution
This is the repository for our project submission in the google DSC challenge.

### Dev notes:-
1. The backend part goes in the backend folder and frontend part goes in the frontend folder. Make sure you are in your particular folder before you install any particular node modules and such because it can cause conflicts.
2. Different branches have been created one for frontend and one for backend make changes on that not on the master directly.
3. Do not install anything in the root module unless necessary.
4. Do not commit unnecessary stuff like **Node Modules**. Put them in the gitignore

## Steps to run:-
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies for the root, backend and frontend directories. 
 ``` 
  npm install
 ```
3. cd into the frontend directory and use npm run dev to start the frontend next JS server.
 ```
 cd backend
 npm run dev
 ```
4. cd into the backend directory and use npm start to start the backend express server.
```
cd frontend
npm start

Now the frontend runs on localhost://3000/auth/authentication and the backend runs on localhost://8080<br>
